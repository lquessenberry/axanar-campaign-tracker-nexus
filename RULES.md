# Axanar Campaign Tracker: Project Completion Rules

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Completion

### Authentication Rules
1. **Complete Admin Role System** ✅
   - ✅ Created useRoleBasedAccess hook for centralized role management
   - ✅ Added role-based UI element visibility in AdminLayout (admin/editor-specific links)
   - ✅ Implemented admin_users table queries with is_super_admin checks
   - ⚠️ Next: Apply role checks to ProtectedAdminRoute component to replace emergency bypass
   - ⚠️ Next: Add role-based conditional rendering to remaining admin components

2. **User Account Management**

   - Finalize account linking between auth users and donor profiles
   - Implement email verification and account confirmation processes

### Routing & Navigation Rules
1. **Fix Admin Navigation Issues**
   - Add proper state persistence for admin navigation
   - ✅ Implemented RouteTransitionGuard component with loading indicators
   - Ensure history objects maintain proper back-navigation state

2. **Route Protection Enhancements**
   - Add consistent role-based route protection across all admin routes
   - Implement proper redirection with return paths after authentication
   - Add route-level error boundaries with fallback UIs

## Phase 2: Feature Completion

### Campaign Management Rules
1. **Campaign CRUD Operations**
   - Complete campaign creation form with validation
   - Implement campaign editing with optimistic UI updates
   - Add campaign deletion with confirmation dialogs
   - Build campaign analytics dashboard with key metrics

2. **Pledge Management**
   - Finalize pledge creation and editing interfaces
   - Implement donor-to-pledge relationships
   - Add pledge status lifecycle management
   - Create pledge reporting and analytics

3. **Donor Management**
   - Complete donor profile merging functionality
   - Implement donor communication history tracking
   - Add donor segmentation and tagging system
   - Create donor analytics and reporting

## Phase 3: Performance & Optimization

### Database Optimization Rules
1. **View Optimization**
   - Materialize complex views in production
   - Add proper indexes for frequently queried columns
   - Implement database-level performance monitoring

2. **Query Optimization**
   - Refactor any SELECT * queries to only request needed columns
   - Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets

   - Implement selective rendering for complex dashboard components
   - Add proper memoization for expensive calculations and components

### Rust Integration Rules (Optional Performance Boost)
1. **WebAssembly Integration**
   - Identify computationally intensive operations (analytics, sorting)
   - Implement these operations as Rust WASM modules
   - Create proper TypeScript interfaces for Rust-generated WASM

2. **Build Process Enhancement**
   - Configure SWC compiler for faster transpilation
   - Optimize Vite configuration for faster HMR
   - Set up proper production build process with tree shaking

## Phase 4: Production Readiness

### Error Handling Rules

   - Implement proper CORS and CSP headers
   - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts

2. **Data Access Controls**
   - Review and refine database permissions
   - Implement proper user role validation for all data operations
   - Add audit logging for sensitive operations

### Deployment Rules
